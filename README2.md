### Analysis Summary

# Codebase Structure Report

This report outlines the directory structure of the backend, frontend, and the `docker-compose.yml` file, providing a high-level overview of the project's organization.

## Backend

The backend service is primarily located in the `backend/` directory. It contains the core application logic, data storage, and API endpoints.

### Key Components:

*   **`backend/app/`**: This directory houses the main Python application.
    *   **`api/`**: Defines the API routes and their handlers.
        *   `routes/`: Contains individual route definitions for different functionalities like chat, file management, and health checks.
            *   [chat.py](file:backend/app/api/routes/chat.py)
            *   [files.py](file:backend/app/api/routes/files.py)
            *   [health.py](file:backend/app/api/routes/health.py)
    *   **`schema/`**: Defines data models and schemas used for request validation and response serialization.
        *   [chat.py](file:backend/app/schema/chat.py)
        *   [file.py](file:backend/app/schema/file.py)
    *   **`services/`**: Contains business logic and service-layer implementations.
        *   [chat.py](file:backend/app/services/chat.py)
        *   [clustering.py](file:backend/app/services/clustering.py)
        *   [storage.py](file:backend/app/services/storage.py)
    *   **`utils/`**: Provides utility functions, such as logging.
        *   [logging.py](file:backend/app/utils/logging.py)
    *   [config.py](file:backend/app/config.py): Configuration settings for the backend application.
    *   [main.py](file:backend/app/main.py): The main entry point for the backend application.
*   **`backend/data/`**: Stores application data, including datasets and a database file.
    *   `datasets/`: Contains sample data in parquet format.
    *   [app.db](file:backend/data/app.db): SQLite database file.
    *   [clustering_intermediate_Sample_data.parquet](file:backend/data/clustering_intermediate_Sample_data.parquet): Intermediate data for clustering.
*   [backend/dockerfile](file:backend/dockerfile): Dockerfile for building the backend service image.
*   [backend/requirements1.txt](file:backend/requirements1.txt): Python dependencies for the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend service is located in the `frontend/` directory and is responsible for the user interface and interaction.

### Key Components:

*   **`frontend/app_pages/`**: Contains different pages of the web application.
    *   [cag.py](file:frontend/app_pages/cag.py)
    *   [chat.py](file:frontend/app_pages/chat.py)
    *   [files.py](file:frontend/app_pages/files.py)
    *   [home.py](file:frontend/app_pages/home.py)
*   **`frontend/utils/`**: Provides utility functions for the frontend, such as styling.
    *   [steamlit_style.py](file:frontend/app/utils/steamlit_style.py)
*   [frontend/api_client.py](file:frontend/api_client.py): Client for interacting with the backend API.
*   [frontend/config.py](file:frontend/config.py): Configuration settings for the frontend application.
*   [frontend/dockerfile](file:frontend/dockerfile): Dockerfile for building the frontend service image.
*   [frontend/main.py](file:frontend/main.py): The main entry point for the frontend application.
*   [frontend/requirements1.txt](file:frontend/requirements1.txt): Python dependencies for the frontend.

## Docker Compose

[docker-compose.yml](file:docker-compose.yml): This file defines and configures the multi-container Docker application, orchestrating the backend and frontend services.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Overall Project Structure**
   The project is organized into three main parts: a `backend` service for core application logic, a `frontend` service for the user interface, and a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate these services.

2. **Exploring the Backend Service**
   The `backend` service handles the core application logic, data storage, and API endpoints. Its main application code resides in the `app/` directory, which includes `api/` for defining routes, `schema/` for data models, `services/` for business logic, and `utils/` for utility functions. It also has a `data/` directory for storing application data like datasets and a database file.

3. **Exploring the Frontend Service**
   The `frontend` service is responsible for the user interface and interaction. It contains `app_pages/` for different web application pages and `utils/` for frontend utility functions. It also includes an `api_client.py` for interacting with the backend API.

4. **Understanding Docker Compose Orchestration**
   The `docker-compose.yml` file is crucial for defining and configuring the multi-container Docker application. It orchestrates how the `backend` and `frontend` services run together.
